## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Test cases for installation and compatibility issues by Shad Nygren (@ShadNygren)
  - `test_installation.py` - Tests for DeepSpeed/Pydantic compatibility (issue #182)
  - `test_triton_compatibility.py` - Tests for Triton GPU compatibility (issue #185)
  - `test_esm_loading.py` - Tests for ESM weights loading with PyTorch 2.6+ (issue #176)
- CHANGELOG.md to track project changes (Apache 2.0 compliance)

### Fixed
- Issue #182: DeepSpeed and Pydantic v2.x compatibility by upgrading to DeepSpeed 0.17.5
- Issue #185: Triton kernel compatibility with consumer GPUs (RTX 3090/4090)
  - Added PyTorch fallback when Triton is unavailable or unsupported
  - Enables Protenix to run on consumer hardware without code changes
  - Modified `protenix/model/tri_attention/__init__.py` to provide transparent fallback
- Inference robustness:
  - Fixed invalid MSA success assertion in FASTA flow (`runner/batch_inference.py`).
  - Added explicit input JSON validation for non-empty top-level list (`runner/inference.py`).
  - Hardened model-name parsing to avoid crashes on unexpected naming (`runner/inference.py`, `runner/batch_inference.py`).
